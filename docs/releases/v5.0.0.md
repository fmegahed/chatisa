## Bug Fixes

### Model Compatibility
- **Gemini 3 Pro Preview**: Fixed empty response issue caused by reasoning tokens consuming the entire output limit. Now uses model's configured `max_tokens` from config
- **GPT-5 Mini Temperature**: Fixed "Unsupported parameter: 'temperature'" error by conditionally excluding temperature for models that don't support it
- **AI Sandbox Image Download**: Fixed `'HttpxBinaryResponseContent' object is not subscriptable` error by using direct HTTP requests for container file downloads

### UI Fixes
- Fixed broken emoji icons (showing as "?") in AI Comparisons by replacing with text labels like `[Vision]`, `[Open]`, `[Free]`

---

## Configuration Changes

### New Model Tag
Added `"sandbox"` tag to model configuration for AI Sandbox compatibility:
```python
# config.py - Models with sandbox tag
"gpt-5.2-2025-12-11": {
    "tags": ["premium", "coding", "reasoning", "large_context", "transcription", "sandbox"]
},
"gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07": {
    "tags": ["fast", "cost_effective", "coding", "transcription", "sandbox"]
}
```

To add new models to AI Sandbox, simply add `"sandbox"` to their tags array.

### Sidebar Configuration
- `render_sidebar()` now accepts `skip_navigation` parameter for custom page layouts
- New `render_clear_conversation_button()` function for consistent clear functionality
